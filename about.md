I have many interests and more hobbies than time. I'm a husband, father, and member of the US Military.
The interest I'll be writing most about in this blog is infosec, which I spend most of my professsional time working in and some of my free time working on. 

I do want to share something that I've tried to take to heart. I heard a talk by Chris Nickerson where he was talking about failed relationships because he spent too much time working. Paraphrasing, he said
 no one ever lay on their death bed and said I wish I'd read the man page for nmap one more time.

I hope this helps your passions for information security, and that you find it useful.
